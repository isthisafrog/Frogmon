Frogmon - Extreme Kaizo Ironmon
| Proposed Rule | Details | Frog's Thoughts/Notes |
|---|----------------------------------|---|
| | <h3>Highly unlikely to be implemented</h3> | |
| More BST Restrictions | No mons 540 BST or higher unless they are evolved into. (Arcanine, Blissey, Gyarados, Kingdra, Milotic, Snorlax, Dragonite, Salamence, etc) | This is a rule I am very unsure about. Taking too many mons out of the viable pool may be annoying and turn people off from using these rules, but at the same time, 540+ BSt are some of the most winning Kaizo mons. |
| More Banned Abilities | Restrictions for 540+ BST mons  :<br/><br/>Battle Armor/Shell Armor, Clear Body/White Smoke, Shed Skin, Volt Absorb, Water Absorb, Flash Fire, Levitate | I'm not sure if having too many restrictions will be annoying, but at the same time these abilities are very strong when coupled with specific mons (Ie Volt Absorb on Milotic) |
| Status Heal Trade-in | Status heals of one specific type may be traded in at a 2:1 ratio for status heals of another specific type. | For example, 2 Antidotes for 1 Paralyze Heal. No Full Heals or Full Restores. ("Specific type" refers to: Antidote, Ice Heal, Burn Heal, Parlyz Heal) <br/><br/>No mixing and matching. You cannot trade in 1 Ice Heal + 1 Awakeing for 1 Antidote. |
| More Item Set Trade-ins | You can now trade in several different sets of items for HP or status heals:<br/><br/>1 Pearl + 1 Big Pearl -> 1 Super Potion OR 1 Status Heal of a specific type<br/><br/>1 Star Piece + 1 Stardust -> 1 Super Potion OR 1 Status Heal of a specific type | "Specific type" refers to: Antidote, Ice Heal, Burn Heal, Parlyz Heal. <br/><br/>Trades may occur multiple times per run.<br/><br/>If you find 3 Nuggets prior to having access to Full Restores or Full Heals you may instead trade for an equal amount of Best Potion Available OR Status Heals of a specific types |
| | <h3>Thinking about it</h3> | |
| Emergency Room | ONCE per run, you may visit a Pokecenter WITHOUT any impact on the current Route/Mini-Dungeon. This supercedes all other rules regarding Mini-Dungeons
| | <h3>On-the-Fence Holdover from Survival</h3> | |
| PP Item restrictions | You may only use one PP Up per move. No PP Max allowed. You can however trade in PP Max for a single Hyper Potion or 3 status healing items |  This isn't a full survival ruleset so I don't think this restriction is required. |
| | <h3>On-the-Fence Elite 4 Holdovers from Survival</h3> | |
| No Boosting Items | In the Elite 4, you are no longer allowed to use boosting items like X Items/Dire Hits/Guard Specs etc. other than those that are consumable held items | Boosting items only give +1 to a stat. Generally the setup moves are the big problem, and those usually give +1 to two different stats or +2 to a single stat. I don't think this rule is required here. |
