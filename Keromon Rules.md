# Keromon (Currently in planning+testing phase)
Keromon - Gauntlet Ironmon

<b>What is the goal?</b> A tougher Kaizo-like experience that offers a blend of traditional Kaizo and Survival rulesets, as well as introducing new rules. The intention is to be a slightly more difficult than Kaizo, but with a fresh spin.

The short of it, if you are already familiar with Kaizo:
- You can now choose your starter mon (Controversial, I know)
- 499 or less BST can go to Sevii Islands
- All routes are considered mini-dungeons and trainers must be fought before you visit a Pokecenter. If you fail to clear a path necessary for story progress prior to your next Pokecenter visit, you lose. More detailed explanation in the full ruleset.
- Purchase of items dependent of Pokemon BST after Brock/prior to Route 3
- TMs are 50% learnable however you can learn from any source: Starter Held Item, Ground Items, Gyms, and Move Tutors. You may only learn 1 TM for every odd number of Gym badges earned. (1st TM after Gym 1, 2nd TM after Gym 3, etc). This means you can potentially learn 4 TMs total by the end of the game. Choose wisely what and when you learn.
- You can use healing items outside of battle only in Towns and Routes (Including Cycling Road and Viridian Forest)
- You can trade in some specific-type status heals for other specific-type status heals at a 2:1 ratio
- Flute turn in mechanic (same as Survival)
- More item set trade-ins (small rewards, not game breaking)
- Important trainer's Pokemon get held items
- No excessive stalling
- No excessive setup moves in Elite 4

Note: As this is still a work in progress, I am gathering feedback and have some possible rule changes listed in the "Proposed Rules" section.

## Keromon Complete Ruleset

| Rule | Details | Notes |
|---|----------------------------------|---|
| | <h3>Keromon Specific Rules</h3> | |
| Choose Your Destiny | You may choose your starter | This means you'll likely be making more lab escapes and as a result, Brock attempts as well.<br/><br/>Don't worry though, there are aspects that will make your journey more difficult... |    
| BST Restriction | No mons 560 BST or higher unless they are evolved into. (Dragonite, Salamence, etc). | You can find a list of BST (Base Stats Total) <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VIII-present" title="Bulbapedia">HERE</a> |
| Banned Abilities | If your Pokemon has BST of 400 or more, the following abilities are banned: Huge Power/Pure Power | You can find a list of BST (Base Stats Total) <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VIII-present" title="Bulbapedia">HERE</a> |
| TM Restrictions | All TMs are 50% randomly learnable. You may use TMs from most sources: Starter/Lab Held Item, Ground Items, Gyms, and Move Tutors. You can learn one TM for each odd numbered Gym badge you obtain. This means you can learn a total of 4 TMs. (After Total Gym Badges 1,3,5,7) | Be very mindful of when and where you learn moves. For example if you learn Brock's TM, you will be unable to learn any more until you beat Gym 3. If the move tutors after Mt. Moon have something you really want, you won't be able to double back until after you get Surf. <br/><br/>You cannot learn the TM that a starter/lab mon may be holding until you earn your first badge.<br/><br/>TMs held by any Pokemon you catch in the wild (Pivots, HM friends) may NOT be used unless found elsewhere at a later time.<br/><br/>You may NOT use TMs held by purchased Pokemon (ie Magikarp before Mt. Moon). |
| Move Tutors | You may learn from move tutors, however they count towards both the total TM limit (4) as well as must follow the TM learning restrictions (See TM Restrictions rule above) | Move tutor locations:<br/><br/>- Route 4 (2 tutors)<br/>- Viridian City (Requires Cut or Surf)<br/>- Pewter City<br/>- Celadon City<br/>- Celadon Department Store<br/>- Saffron City<br/>- Fuchsia City<br/>- Silph Co.<br/>- Pokemon Lab (Cinnabar Island)<br/>- One Island<br/>- Mt. Ember (One Island)<br/>- Victory Road |
| One Shot Dungeons |	You can only enter a dungeon once unless the story requires a revisit |	A Dungeon refers to:<br/>- Any Hideout<br>- Any Cave<br/>- Any Building with Trainers (Dojo, Gym, etc)
| Routes are Mini-Dungeons | Each "route" with trainers is considered a mini-dungeon. This means that you only have ONE oppotunity to fight trainers in that route. Some routes must be visited twice or more for story progress but the first time you fight a trainer in a route, that triggers the "mini-dungeon". <br/><br/>What this means is that is you fail to clear all "required" trainers to fully progress in specific routes in one go (for example a clear path towards Bill's house) the run is OVER. Once you leave the route to heal you may never fight any additonal trainers in that route. You MAY skip optional trainers, but you may never fight them if you've completed that area's mini-dungeon. | Some key things to watch out for:<br/><br/>Thinking you've cleared a route, go heal, and then accidentally run into a trainer on that same route (such as a spinner that you dodged previously). Too bad, your run is now over. There is NO wiggle room for interpretation on this rule. No make-up clauses like "skipping a random trainer on the next route". Your. Run. Is. Over.<br/><br/>Transitioning from one route to another and starting the "mini dungeon" on the new route prior to healing. This doesn't mean the run is over, but you will be locked into the mini-dungeon. Routes you should keep mind of this happening are:<br/>- Routes 12 (It is initially only partially acessible without the Poke Flute)<br/>- Routes 13,14,15<br/>- Route 16, 17 (Cycling Road), 18<br/>- Route 19 (Divers on beach which are sometimes done prior to surfing portion)<br/>- Route 20 (Seafoam Islands separate this route in 2 but it counts as 1 mini-dungeon) |
| Mini-Dungeon Exceptions | Viridian Forest, as it would be nearly impossible to get through the early game if this was considered a dungeon<br/><br/>Pokemon tower, as it must be entered twice for in initial Rival fight (as per standard kaizo rules) and then story progression (Silph Scope)<br/><br/>Rival in Celeadon and the Rocket behind the house in Celadon are considered separate mini-dungeons. |
| Prepare for the Gauntlet | Immediately after defeating Brock, you may purchase a number of potions and status healing items from Pewter City Mart dependent on the BST of your current Pokemon. Eligible status healing items: Antidote, Parlyz Heal, Awakening, Burn Heal.<br/><br/>You must purchase these prior to starting Route 3 trainers. | 500+ BST: 5 Potions, 1 status healing item<br/><br/>450-499 BST: 10 Potions 2 status healing items<br/><br/>400-449 BST: 15 Potions 3 status healing items<br/><br/>175-399 BST: 20 Potions 4 status healing items |
| No Additional Shops |	The only shop visit allowed is the post-Brock one, as noted above. Otherwise, you can only use items that you pick up. No use of stores except for Pokeballs, Repels, and the Status Healing Item exchange and PP Max exchange noted in separate rules. |	You may not abuse respawning items by picking them up more than once (Mt. Moon, Underground paths, Swimming routes) |
| Status Heal Trade-in | Status heals of one specific type may be traded in at a 2:1 ratio for status heals of another specific type. | For example, 2 Antidotes for 1 Paralyze Heal. No Full Heals or Full Restores. ("Specific type" refers to: Antidote, Ice Heal, Burn Heal, Parlyz Heal) <br/><br/>No mixing and matching. You cannot trade in 1 Ice Heal + 1 Awakeing for 1 Antidote. |
| More Item Set Trade-ins | You can now trade in several different sets of items for HP or status heals:<br/><br/>(1) Tiny Mushroom + (1) Big Mushroom -> 1 Super Potion OR 1 Status Heal of a specific type<br/><br/>(1) Star Piece + (1) Stardust -> 1 Super Potion OR 1 Status Heal of a specific type<br/><br/>(3) Nugget -> 1 Full Restore OR 3 Full Heals | "Specific type" refers to: Antidote, Ice Heal, Burn Heal, Parlyz Heal. <br/><br/>Trades may occur multiple times per run.<br/><br/>If you find 3 Nuggets prior to having access to Hyper Potions or Full Heals you may instead trade for an equal amount of Super Potions OR Status Heals or a specific Type |
| Healing Item Restrictions | You may use items outside of battle only in Towns and Routes (Including Cycling Road and Viridian Forest) | This means you cannot use items outside of battle in Mt. Moon, S.S. Anne, Rock Tunnel, Game Center, Rocket Hideout, Pokemon Tower, Pokemon Mansion, Silph Co, Fighting Dojo, all Gyms, Victory Road, and Elite 4. |
| | <h3>Kaizo and Survival Borrowed Rules</h3> | |
| Randomize the Game | All Pokémon, movesets, and items are randomized, with Trainer Pokémon & Wild Pokémon levels increased by 50%.  | Full randomizer settings found in the "Settings String" section |
| One Pokémon at a time |	You may only use one Pokémon at all times. The only additional Pokémon you can carry is an HM Friend(s). <br/><br/>If you wish to swap a Pokémon that you see in the wild, you commit to that new mon the moment you catch it unless you state beforehand it is an HM friend (HM friend cannot be used in battle swaps) |	You do not need to stop using your HM friend if they die in a dual battle. <br/><br/>HM Friends cannot be used to your advantage when it comes to Abilities like Pick Up, Sand Stream, Hail, etc |
| Stay in your weight class |	You may only catch a Pokémon that is up to 4 levels higher than your current Pokémon's level. | |
| No Healing Moves |	No Healing Moves of any kind (Recover, Milk Drink etc, No Drainpunch etc, No Leech Seed. No Refresh/Aroma etc) No Spore No Assist. This does not include Metronome. |	If your starter pokemon has a banned move, you may use it in the lab fight only. Healing moves are not acceptable to be used under ANY circumstance outside the lab, even if full health. |
| No Killing Wild Pokémon |	No intentionally fighting any wild Pokémon. |	If a wild mon uses explode/self destruct/momento/etc, that is fine, but avoid defeating wild Pokémon at all costs. Do not abuse encountering Pokemon that are known to have abilities like explode as this will invalidate your run. |
| Held Items Restriction |	The only Held Items allowed are Evolution items and Consumable Items like berries and herbs. | Focus Sash is NOT allowed |
| No Healing Stations in Dungeons |	No Pokecenter-like healing in Dungeons (Example - Rocket Hideout NPC, SS Anne Bed, etc) |	Forced heals from the story are fine but you cannot go back for more |
| Banned Items | No use of any flute items for status healing | |
| Flute Favors | Once per run you may go to a store to trade colored flutes. You may sell 1 of each color of flute, for each of which you may buy either 1 super potion, or any status healing item. If you collect a full set of all 5 Flutes (Red/Blue/Yellow/Black/White) you will be allowed to instead purchase a total of two Hyper Potion and five Full Heals. You may only trade flutes once per run. | You may not redeem flutes for Full Restores. Once you turn any flute in, you may not return to a store to turn any other flutes in, even if you find a different color. |
| Weak Pokemon may Challenge the Islands | If your pokemon has BST of 499 or less: The Sevii Islands are now legal, but you can only choose to go there or not immediately after exiting Blaine's gym when Bill invites you. | You may not use a Pokemon Center (or equivalent NPC) before leaving Cinnabar or while on the Sevii islands. You may not return to the islands after completing them. |
| No Relearner Abuse |	You may use Move Relearner but cannot relearn the same move repeated times | |
| Accidental Kills | If you accidentally kill a Pokémon while trying to scout a pivot, you DO NOT have to reset the run, but you must pivot to one of the mons in that route before leaving. |	That means you cannot go and heal until another new mon is caught as a pivot |
| Fluctuating Growth Rates | All Pokémon have Fluctuating Growth Rate except for Legendaries which are set to Slow. |	This ensures no pokes evolve into a legendary and a lower level for your main in the endgame |
| Let your Friends Grow |	If a Pokémon is about to evolve, you can’t stop it or use an Everstone. | If you have a pokemon that evolves via a stone, you are not required to use the stone on it.
| Game Over |	Once your primary Pokémon has fainted, the run is over, and you must restart with a newly randomized game. | |
| HM Restrictions |	No HM Moves in battle | The only time you may teach HM moves is to HM friends |
| Stolen Items | You may not intentionally steal items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc. |	If you steal from a pokemon that you do not end up catching in that battle, throw the item away. |
| Shiny Clause |	If you encounter a shiny, you are allowed to kill it for EXP. |	You may not increase the shiny pokemon rate using the randomizer |
| Don't Give Up Without a Fight |	You may not reset before the first battle if you don't like the starter Pokémon. After that it's fine. |	You might be surprised how far you can go with what looks like a terrible starter |
| Important Trainer's Pokemon get Held Items | The Randomizer option to add held items to Boss Trainers and Important Trainers must be enabled and set to Sensible Items. | If you steal an item from a trainer that you are not allowed to hold, you must remove it once the battle ends. |
| No Excessive Stalling | You may only stall 5 turns per battle using balls or any item that is not sacrificed to waste a turn. |	This does not apply to wasting turns for your partner in a double battle. |
| | <h3>Elite 4 Specific Rule</h3> | |
| No Excessive Setup | In the Elite 4, you are allowed to use ONE (1) non-combat stat boosting move ONCE per fight. Calm Mind/Swords Dance/Iron Defense etc. | There are no restrictions on X Item usage. |

## Settings String

FireRed LeafGreen Pokemon Randomizer ZX setting string (version 4.5.0 required): 319WRIEEjIBAAQABwCRAAKeBnsECQEACQACCQAuEgAAAAAABRi45ATkAYYICTIGBAIyEwUAEEZpcmUgUmVkIChVKSAxLjE021GwivRugg==

## Frequently Asked Rule Clarifications

Game Center and Rocket Hideout are considered separate dungeons, and you may heal between defeating the Rocket member in Game Center and going downstairs into Rocket Hideout.

Pokemon Tower Rival is required to fight the first time you enter Lavender Town, but the Tower also requires a revisit later once you get the Silph Scope. This means you may clear as many trainers as you want in your first entry for Rival up until the Silph Scope requirement. On your second entry, you could then clear any trainers you skipped and the 3 new Rocket Trainers after the Silph Scope encounter event.

Pokemon Tower healing pad may be used ONLY IF you consider the dungeon done and will have no more fights for that entry(First for Rival/Second for Silph Scope). If you use the healing pad (which is considered a Pokecenter visit) and encounter another fight during that entry, the run is over. NO EXCEPTIONS.

## Some considerations that may implemented, dependent on testing

| Proposed Rule | Details | Frog's Thoughts/Notes |
|---|----------------------------------|---|
| | <h3>Highly unlikely to be implemented</h3> | |
| More BST Restrictions | No mons 540 BST or higher unless they are evolved into. (Arcanine, Blissey, Gyarados, Kingdra, Milotic, Snorlax, Dragonite, Salamence, etc) | This is a rule I am very unsure about. Taking too many mons out of the viable pool may be annoying and turn people off from using these rules, but at the same time, 540+ BSt are some of the most winning Kaizo mons. |
| | <h3>Thinking about it</h3> | |
| More Banned Abilities | Restrictions for 540+ BST mons  :<br/><br/>Battle Armor/Shell Armor, Clear Body/White Smoke, Shed Skin, Volt Absorb, Water Absorb, Flash Fire, Levitate | I'm not sure if having too many restrictions will be anooying, but at the same time these abilities are very strong when coupled with specific mons (Ie Volt Absorb on Milotic) |
| | <h3>On-the-Fence Holdover from Survival</h3> | |
| PP Item restrictions | You may only use one PP Up per move. No PP Max allowed. You can however trade in PP Max for a single Hyper Potion or 3 status healing items |  This isn't a full survival ruleset so I don't think this restriction is required. |
| | <h3>On-the-Fence Elite 4 Holdovers from Survival</h3> | |
| No Boosting Items | In the Elite 4, you are no longer allowed to use boosting items like X Items/Dire Hits/Guard Specs etc. other than those that are consumable held items | Boosting items only give +1 to a stat. Generally the setup moves are the big problem, and those usually give +1 to two different stats or +2 to a single stat. I don't think this rule is required here. |
