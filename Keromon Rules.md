# Keromon
Keromon - Gauntlet Ironmon

<b>What is the goal?</b> A tougher Kaizo-like experience that offers a blend of traditional Kaizo and Survival rulesets, as well as introducing new rules. The intention is to be a slightly more difficult than Kaizo, but with a fresh spin.

The short of it, if you are already familiar with Kaizo:
- 499 or less BST can go to Sevii Islands
- All routes are considered mini-dungeons and trainers must be fought before you visit a Pokecenter. If you fail to clear a path necessary for story progress prior to your next Pokecenter visit, you lose. More detailed explanation in the full ruleset.
- Purchase of items dependent of Pokemon BST after Brock/prior to Route 3
- TMs are 50% learnable however you can learn from most sources: Starter Held Item, Ground Items, Gyms, NPCs, and Move Tutors. You may only learn 1 TM for every odd number of Gym badges earned. (1st TM after Gym 1, 2nd TM after Gym 3, etc). This means you can potentially learn 4 TMs total by the end of the game. Choose wisely what and when you learn.
- Moves from Move Tutors are 50% learnable but must follow the limits/restrictions that TMs do.
- You can use healing items outside of battle only in Towns and Routes (Including Cycling Road and Viridian Forest)
- Flute turn in mechanic (same as Survival)
- Nugget turn in mechanic
- Important trainer's Pokemon get held items
- No excessive setup moves in Elite 4

## Keromon Complete Ruleset

| Rule | Details | Notes |
|---|----------------------------------|---|
| | <h3>Keromon Specific Rules</h3> | |
| TM Restrictions | You may use TMs from most sources: Starter/Lab Held Item, Ground Items, Gyms, NPCs, and Move Tutors. You can learn one TM for each odd numbered Gym badge earned. This means you can learn a total of 4 TMs. (After Total Gym Badges 1,3,5,7)<br/><br/>TMs purchased from Marts/Department Store/Game Center are NOT valid.<br/><br/>All TMs are 50% randomly learnable. | Be very mindful of when and where you learn moves. For example if you learn Brock's TM, you will be unable to learn any more until you beat Gym 3. If the move tutors after Mt. Moon have something you really want, you won't be able to double back until after you get Surf. <br/><br/>You cannot learn the TM that a starter/lab mon may be holding until you earn your first badge.<br/><br/>TMs held by any Pokemon you catch in the wild (Pivots, HM friends) may NOT be used unless found elsewhere at a later time.<br/><br/>You may NOT use TMs held by purchased Pokemon (ie Magikarp before Mt. Moon). |
| Move Tutors | You may learn from Move Tutors, however they count towards both the total TM limit (4) as well as must follow the TM learning restrictions (See TM Restrictions rule above)<br/><br/>All moves from Move Tutors are 50% randomly learnable. | Move Tutor locations:<br/><br/>- Viridian City (Requires Cut or Surf)<br/>- Pewter City (Requires Cut)<br/>- Route 4 (2 tutors)<br/>- Rock Tunnel<br/>- Celadon City (Requires Surf)<br/>- Celadon Department Store<br/>- Saffron City (After Silph Co.)<br/>- Fuchsia City<br/>- Silph Co. (2nd Floor)<br/>- Pokemon Lab (Cinnabar Island)<br/>- Mt. Ember (One Island)<br/>- Victory Road (Near exit) |
| One Shot Dungeons |	You can only enter a dungeon once unless the story requires a revisit |	A Dungeon refers to:<br/>- Any Hideout<br>- Any Cave<br/>- Any Building with Trainers (Dojo, Gym, etc)
| Routes are Mini-Dungeons | Each "route" with trainers is considered a mini-dungeon. This means that you only have ONE oppotunity to fight trainers in that route. Some routes must be visited twice or more for story progress but the first time you fight a trainer in a route, that triggers the "mini-dungeon". <br/><br/>What this means is that is you fail to clear all "required" trainers to fully progress in specific routes in one go (for example a clear path towards Bill's house) the run is OVER. Once you leave the route to heal at a Pokecenter you may never fight any additonal trainers in that route. You MAY skip optional trainers, but you may never fight them in the future if you've completed that area's mini-dungeon. | Some key things to watch out for:<br/><br/>Thinking you've cleared a route, go heal, and then accidentally run into a trainer on that same route (such as a spinner that you dodged previously). Too bad, your run is now over. There is NO wiggle room for interpretation on this rule. No make-up clauses like "skipping a random trainer on the next route". Your. Run. Is. Over.<br/><br/>Transitioning from one route to another and starting the "mini dungeon" on the new route prior to healing. This doesn't mean the run is over, but you will be locked into the mini-dungeon. There are also some outes that are split into multiple sections. Routes you should keep mind of this happening are:<br/>- Route 10 (Trainers near Rock Tunnel Entrance, Rock Tunnel Exit, and near Power Plant. If you want to full clear, you must wait until you have Fly and Surf)<br/>- Routes 12 (It is initially only partially acessible without the Poke Flute)<br/>- Routes 13,14,15<br/>- Route 16, 17 (Cycling Road), 18<br/>- Route 19 (Divers on beach which are sometimes done prior to surfing portion)<br/>- Route 20 (Seafoam Islands separate this route in 2 but it counts as 1 mini-dungeon) |
| Stone of Destiny | If you get an evolution stone from the initial PC in your room when the game begins, you may choose a corresponding pokemon from the bench even if it is not currently set as one of your favorites or in the position you would randomly choose. | This means if you get a fire stone, you can choose to take an Eevee on the bench. Water stone, Poliwrath. Etc. |
| Sevii Islands is a Mini-Dungeon | If you choose to go to Sevii Islands with a mon 499 or less BST (See "weak Pokemon may Challenge the Islands" rule), then that entire area (all 3 Islands) is considered a single mini-dungeon.  No Pokecenter visit until you have completed all necessary trainers (and as many optional trainers as you feel comfortable with, like other route mini-dungeons). You may only Pokecenter once you are ready to leave the islands and head back to Kanto. | If you fail to treat this as a mini-dungeon, your run is over. |
| Dungeon/Mini-Dungeon Exceptions | Viridian Forest may be enetered and exited freely between trainer fights as it would be nearly impossible to get through the early game if this was considered a dungeon. This means that prior to Brock, you may use the Pokemon Center between trainer fights.<br/><br/>Pokemon Tower is treated as a 2 part dungeon, as it must be entered twice for in initial Rival fight (as per standard kaizo rules) and then story progression (Silph Scope). This means you can clear as much as you consider safe on the 1st entry and then do the remainder once you obtain the Silph Scope.<br/><br/>Rival in Celeadon and the Rocket behind the house in Cerulean are considered separate mini-dungeons and you may heal after each fight. |
| Prepare for the Gauntlet | Immediately after defeating Brock, you may purchase a number of potions and status healing items from Pewter City Mart dependent on the BST of your current Pokemon. Eligible status healing items: Antidote, Parlyz Heal, Awakening, Burn Heal.<br/><br/>You must purchase these prior to starting Route 3 trainers. | 500+ BST: 10 Potions, 2 status healing item<br/><br/>450-499 BST: 15 Potions 3 status healing items<br/><br/>400-449 BST: 20 Potions 4 status healing items<br/><br/>175-399 BST: 25 Potions 5 status healing items |
| No Additional Shops |	The only shop visit allowed is the post-Brock one, as noted above. Otherwise, you can only use items that you pick up. No use of stores except for Pokeballs, Repels, and Item Set Trade-Ins noted in separate rules. |	You may not abuse respawning items by picking them up more than once (Mt. Moon, Underground paths, Swimming routes) |
| Golden Nuggets | You can now trade in 3 Nuggets for a single (1) Full Restore (Available only from Indigo Plateau Mart) | If you find multiple sets of 3 (ie 6 total, 9 total, etc) you can do this exchange multiple times.<br/><br/>You can choose to instead turn in for Hyper Potions if you do not want to wait to reach the Indigo Plateau. |
| Healing Item Restrictions | You may use items outside of battle only in Towns and Routes (Including Cycling Road and Viridian Forest) | This means you cannot use items outside of battle in Mt. Moon, S.S. Anne, Rock Tunnel, Game Center, Rocket Hideout, Pokemon Tower, Pokemon Mansion, Silph Co, Fighting Dojo, all Gyms, Victory Road, and Elite 4. |

| Accidental Kills | If you accidentally kill a Pokémon while trying to scout a pivot, you DO NOT have to reset the run, but you must pivot to one of the mons in that route before leaving. |	That means you cannot go and heal until another new mon is caught as a pivot |
| Fluctuating Growth Rates | All Pokémon have Fluctuating Growth Rate except for Legendaries which are set to Slow. |	This ensures no pokes evolve into a legendary and a lower level for your main in the endgame |

| Game Over |	Once your primary Pokémon has fainted, the run is over, and you must restart with a newly randomized game. | |
| Rival Fights | You do not have to fight the rival in the S.S. Anne immediately.<br/><br/>The rival in Pokemon Tower is fought AFTER obtaining Silph Scope.	| This means that you must do all of Pokémon Tower in one go after getting the Silph Scope. (No re-entries) |
| HM Restrictions |	No HM Moves in battle | The only time you may teach HM moves is to HM friends |
| Stolen Items | You may not intentionally steal items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc. |	If you steal from a pokemon that you do not end up catching in that battle, throw the item away. |
| Shiny Clause |	If you encounter a shiny, you are allowed to kill it for EXP. |	You may not increase the shiny pokemon rate using the randomizer |
| Don't Give Up Without a Fight |	You may not reset before the first battle if you don't like the starter Pokémon. After that it's fine. |	You might be surprised how far you can go with what looks like a terrible starter |
