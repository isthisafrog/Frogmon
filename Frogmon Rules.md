Frogmon - Extreme Kaizo Ironmon

What is the goal? A tougher Kaizo-like experience that offers a blend of traditional Kaizo and Survival rulesets, as well as introducing new rules. More difficult than Kaizo, but with a fresh spin.

Based off the official ironmon ruleset: https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1

## Frogmon Ruleset

| Rule             | Details                                                 | Notes |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
| Randomize the game | All Pokémon, movesets, and items are randomized, with Trainer Pokémon & Wild Pokémon levels increased by 50%.  | Full randomizer settings below |
| Choose your destiny | You may choose your starter. | However... (see below) |     
| BST Restriction | No mons 540 BST or higher unless they are evolved into. (Arcanine, Blissey, Gyarados, Kingdra, Milotic, Snorlax, etc) | You can find a list of BST (Base Stats Total) here: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VIII-present) |
| Routes are Mni-Dngeons | Each "route" with trainers is considered a mini-dungeon. This means that you only have ONE oppotunity to fight trainers in that route. Some routes must be visited twice or more for story progress but the first time you fight a trainer in a route, that triggers the "mini-dungeon". What this means is that is you fail to clear all "required" trainers to fully progress in specific routes in one go (for example a clear path towards Bill's house) the run is OVER. Once you leave the route to heal you may never fight any additonal trainers in that route. You MAY skip optional trainers, but you may never fight them if you've completed that area's dungeon/mini-dungeon. | Things to watch out for:
    Thinking you've cleared a route, go heal, and then accidentally run into a trainer on that same route (such as a spinner that you dodged previously). Too bad, your run is now over. There is NO wiggle room for interpretation on this rule. No silly make-up clauses like "skipping a random trainer on the next route. Your. Run. Is. Over.
    Transitioning from one route to another and starting the "mini dungeon" on the new route prior to healing. This doesn't mean the run is over, but you will be locked into the mini-dungeon. Routes you should keep mind of this happening are:
      Routes 12,13,14,15
      Route 16, 17(Cycling Road), 18
      Route 19(Divers on beach which are sometimes done prior to), 20
      Route 20 (Seafoam Islands separate this route in 2 but it coutns as 1 mini-dungeon) |
      
| Mini-Dungeon Exceptions | Viridian Forest as it would be almsot impossible to get through the early game if this was considered a dungeon
Pokemon tower, as it must be entered twice for in initial Rival fight (as per standard kaizo rules) and then story progression (Silph Scope)
Rival in Celeadon and the Rocket behind the house in Celadon are considered separate mini-dungeons. |

Status heals of one specific type may be traded in at a 2:1 ratio for status heals of another specific type. For example, 2 Antidotes for 1 Paralyze Heal. No Full Heals or Full Restores. [Eligible types: Antidote, Ice Heal, Burn Heal, Paralyze Heal)

The PP Max restriction/trade in rule is still in play.

The setup move restriction on E4+Champ is still in play.

The X-item restriction on E4+Champ is still in play.

Important Trainer's Pokemon get Held Items

No Excessive Stalling rule still applies.

All TMs from Gyms are learnable.

Some frequently asked questions and their clarifications:

Game Center and Rocket Hideout are considered separate dungeons, and you may heal between defeating the Rocket member in Game Center and going downstairs into Rocket Hideout.

Pokemon Tower Rival is required to fight the first time you enter Lavender Town, but also requires a revisit later once you get the Silph Scope. This also means you may clear as many trainers as you want in your first entry for Rival up until the Silph Scope requirement. On your second entry, you could then clear any trainers you skipped and the 3 new Rocket Trainers after the Silph Scope encounter event.

Pokemon Tower healing Pad may be used ONLY IF you consider the dungeon done and will have no more fights for that entry(Rival/Silph Scope). If you use the pad and entering another fight during that entry, the run is OVER. No exceptions.

Some considerations that I may implement:

The flute mechanic/trade in rule is still in play.

Banned Abilities applies: If your pokemon has BST of 400 or more, the following abilities are banned: Huge Power/Pure Power, Battle Armor/Shell Armor, Parental Bond, Protean, Fur Coat, Magic Guard

After defeating Brock, you may purchase five (5) potions from the Mart.
